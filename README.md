## Overview

The Onna platform API enables you to programmatically upload your data into our [Knowledge Integration Platform](https://onna.com/platform/ "What is a Knowledge Integration Platform").

This unlocks the possibility to have all your data in one place
and turn it into knowledge—even data we don't support directly with one of our [connectors](#about-connectors "More info about connectors").

Our API follows REST principles and adheres to the [OpenAPI 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.1.md "OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification on GitHub") Specification (OAS).
This documentation assumes you're familiar with this standard.
